# African-American Periodicals: a Visual Bibliography

## How To Update

To change underlying data, edit `data/bibliography.csv`. To change the decades
or topics we display, edit `bin/common.py`. After editing, build the site by
running `bin/build.sh`. Don't edit index.html directly.

## Known Issues

See `issues.csv` for a list of entries from [African-American newspapers and
periodicals: a national
bibliography](https://archive.org/details/africanamericanne00dank) that could
not be automatically processed and so are not included in
`data/bibliography.csv`.
